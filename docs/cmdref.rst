Output Directory Structure
==========================

DV Flow Manager creates an output directory structure that mirrors
the task graph being executed. Each top-level task has a 
directory within the run directory. Compound tasks have a nested
directory structure.

There are two top-level directory that always exist:

* cache - Stores task memento data and other cross-run artifacts
* log - Stores execution trace and log files

Each task directory contains some standard files:

* <task_name>.exec_data.json - Information about the task inputs, outputs, and executed commands.
* logfiles - Command-specific log files


Viewing Task Execution Data
===========================

After a run has completed, the `log` directory will contain a JSON-formatted execution
trace file named <root_task>.trace.json. This file is formatted in 
`Google Event Trace Format <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview?tab=t.0#heading=h.yr4qxyxotyw>`_,
and can be processed by tools from the `Perfetto <https://perfetto.dev/>`_ project.

An execution is shown in the Perfetto UI below. In addition to seeing information
about how tasks executed with respect to each other, data about individual
tasks can be seen.
